  <p>
    Web programming, or web development, is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. 
    It involves various tasks, including writing code, designing user interfaces, and managing data storage, 
    all to create interactive and user-friendly online experiences. 
    Here's a breakdown of key aspects:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><b>1. Front-end Development:</b></dt>
    <dd><b>Focus:</b> Deals with the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of a website â€” what users see and interact with directly.</dd>
    <dd><b>Core Technologies:</b> HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity).</dd>
    <dd><b>Example:</b> Designing the layout of a webpage, adding animations, and handling user input.</dd>

    <br><br>

    <dt><b>2. Back-end Development:</b></dt>
    <dd><b>Focus:</b> Handles the server-side logic, databases, and other behind-the-scenes operations that power the website.</dd>
    <dd><b>Core Technologies:</b> Programming languages like Python, Java, PHP, or JavaScript (with Node.js), and databases like MySQL or MongoDB.</dd>
    <dd><b>Example:</b> Processing user logins, handling data storage, and generating dynamic content.</dd>

    <br><br>

    <dt><b>3. Web Development Lifecycle:</b></dt>
    <dd><b>Phases:</b> Typically includes research, planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.</dd>
    <dd><b>Collaboration:</b> Web development often involves teamwork between front-end and back-end developers, as well as designers and other specialists.</dd>

    <br><br>

    <dt><b>4. Key Concepts:</b></dt>
    <dd><b>APIs:</b> Application Programming Interfaces allow different software components to communicate and exchange data.</dd>
    <dd><b>Data Formats:</b> Standardized ways to structure data for transmission between systems, like JSON and XML.</dd>
    <dd><b>Databases:</b> Systems for storing and managing website data.</dd>
    <dd><b>Frameworks and Libraries:</b> Pre-built sets of code that simplify web development tasks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).</dd>
    <dd><b>Version Control:</b> Using systems like Git to track changes to code and collaborate effectively.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>
    Web programming is constantly evolving, with new technologies and best practices emerging regularly. 
    Staying updated with the latest trends is crucial for web developers to build effective and engaging websites and applications.
